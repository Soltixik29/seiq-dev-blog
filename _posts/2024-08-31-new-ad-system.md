**We've added advertisements today, but don't worry—they're only temporary.** 

Developing and maintaining Seiq comes with its costs, and these ads are a small way for us to offset some of those expenses. If you'd like to support us more directly and enjoy an ad-free experience, consider purchasing our premium features from the store. Your support helps us continue to improve Seiq and bring you the best possible experience.
